Hello, welcome to my Switch_functions project

Description:
The Personalized Recipe Recommender project aims to develop a Java-based application that suggests personalized recipes based on user preferences and dietary restrictions. Leveraging object-oriented programming principles and Java's robust ecosystem, the application will employ algorithms to analyze user data and generate tailored recommendations.

Key Features:

User Profile Management: Users will create profiles specifying their dietary restrictions, allergies, ingredient preferences, and cooking skill level.

Recipe Database: A comprehensive database of recipes will be integrated, categorized by cuisine, meal type, and ingredients.

Recommendation Engine: Utilizing collaborative filtering or content-based recommendation techniques, the system will analyze user data to generate personalized recipe suggestions.

Ingredient Substitution: The application will provide suggestions for ingredient substitutions to accommodate dietary restrictions and preferences.

Recipe Rating and Feedback: Users will be able to rate recipes and provide feedback, allowing the system to continuously improve recommendation accuracy.

Graphical User Interface (GUI): The application will feature a user-friendly GUI allowing for seamless interaction and navigation.

Technologies:

Backend: Java
Database: MySQL or SQLite
GUI Framework: JavaFX or Swing
Potential Extensions:

Integration with external APIs for accessing additional recipe databases or nutritional information.
Implementation of user authentication and authorization for secure user accounts.
Incorporation of natural language processing for advanced recipe search capabilities.
Project Goals:

The goal of the Personalized Recipe Recommender project is to provide users with a personalized and intuitive platform for discovering new recipes that suit their tastes, dietary requirements, and cooking preferences, enhancing their overall cooking experience.
